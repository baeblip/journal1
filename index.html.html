hello web <br>
This is my <strong> first </strong> day of <u>html</u> class. <br>Welcome to my webpage.
<h2>Day1</h2>
<h3>>My thoughts or <a href="https://atom.io/"target="_blank" title="atom website">summary</a></h3>
<p>There has been several tags invented and some of them are not frequently anymore.</p> <p>It's not because the function is not used anymore, but more effective eay of <b>tagging</b> has been <u>found, or developed</u>.</p>
Some tags do look similar, and you might think the older one should fade away.<br><br> However, even they look similar, it's not the same at all.
<p style="margin-top:45px;"> CSS can be used to compensate for the limit of some of preexisting tags.</p>
